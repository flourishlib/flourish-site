= Cutting Down on Spam =

This post is now out of date since the forum has moved to a custom solution
that integrates with GitHub via OAuth.

== Original Post ==

Last night I got fed up with the spam that was getting through on the forum and
in tickets. While Akismet and the built-in spam filtering in Trac cut out
99.9% of spam, it is frustrating for site participants to get notification
emails about spam posts.

In order to cut down on the spam messages even more, I've changed the site to
require a user account to post. After finding almost 9,000 spam accounts
created on the site, I've also implemented reCaptcha on the registration form.

I apologize for the inconvenience of registering and logging in to participate,
but I hope these steps can help keep the site even more spam free and keep the
notifications relevant and frustration-free.

If you haven't already created an account, jump over to the [/register
registration page] and sign up!
