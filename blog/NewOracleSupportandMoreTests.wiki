= New Oracle Support and More Tests =

After some prodding from a few interested parties, I took it upon myself to
add Oracle support to Flourish. There now exists full support for Oracle in
the fDatabase, fResult, fUnbufferedResult, fSchema and fSQLTranslation classes.
I've targeted Oracle 10g since I have free access to that via Oracle Database
10g Express Edition, however I believe almost all of the functionality should
work on older versions.

In addition to adding support for Oracle, I took the past couple of months to
add over [/docs/Tests 1800 new tests] that exercise all 16 supported database
extensions and cover most of the functionality of the fDatabase, fResult,
fUnbufferedResult, fSchema and fSQLTranslation classes.

Like other supported databases, the Oracle support in fDatabase will work with
any of the available database extensions for Oracle. This includes OCI8,
PDO_OCI, ODBC and PDO_ODBC. From my testing, the ODBC extensions only work on
Windows because some of the `ALTER SESSION` commands executed by fDatabase are
not supported by the UnixODBC driver. If you have any details on a better way
to configure ODBC on Linux/BSD, please let me know.

In closing I'd like to say thanks to Chris Jones from Oracle and Aurélien
Chivot for their assistance during this process!
