= Offline Documentation =

After a handful of requests, I finally took some time this weekend to create
some offline documentation for Flourish. Starting with r879, every SVN commit
and every time a class documentation page is updated, a single HTML page is
created that contains all of the class documentation, API reference, and
relevant general documentation.

{{{
#!raw
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;"><a href="http://docs.flourishlib.com/single_page_docs/flourish_r880.html"><img src="http://static.flourishlib.com/offline_docs.png" alt="Offline Documentation Preview" style="border: 6px solid #b7b7b7;" /></a></div>
}}}

The file uses the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme data URI scheme]
to allow for a single file containing all HTML, images, CSS and javascript. As
long as you aren't using Internet Explorer, you'll even see the Flourish
favicon.

Unfortunately, IE6 and IE7 don't support the data URI scheme and thus may not
show all images. You probably won't want to use IE anyway, since it can't
handle the 4mb of HTML without slowing to a crawl. Chrome, Firefox, Opera and
Safari all seem to perform just great.

Head on over to the [/docs Documentation page] to grab a copy
while it's hot!
