= Advanced Download =

This page used to contain a form that allowed users to select specific Flourish
classes and download a zip file containing all dependencies. Unfortunately 
this is no longer since Flourish has moved hosting infrastructure to GitHub.

Please see the [/docs/Download regular download page] to get an archive
containing all of the classes.
