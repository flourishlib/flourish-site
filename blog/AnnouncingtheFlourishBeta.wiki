= Announcing the Flourish Beta =

After about a year and a half of development and approximately 150k lines of
code changes, Flourish is now officially in beta.

Flourish is a general PHP library that is focused on being robust, yet easy
to use, secure, portable and well documented. It is specifically ''not''
referred to as a framework because it is quite different from most of the PHP
MVC frameworks currently available.

== Project Overview ==

Here is a brief overview of the library:

 - It is licensed under the MIT license
 - It works with PHP 5.1+
 - It loves Linux/BSD, Solaris and Windows environments
 - It includes [/docs extensive documentation] covering all code,
   plus the [/api API] and other general PHP topics
 - It includes [/docs/Security features and guidance to make sites more secure]
 - No shell access is required, simply [/docs/GettingStarted drop the classes
   in and go]
 - It uses UTF-8 everywhere and provides [/docs/fUTF8 UTF-8 functions] even
   without the [http://php.net/mbstring mbstring] extension
 - It supports [/docs/fDatabase MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and Microsoft SQL
   Server]
 - It includes support for [/docs/FlourishSql one dialect of SQL] across all
   database types
 - It supports almost [/api/fDatabase all extensions for the supported
   databases]
 - It includes powerful, but intuitive [/docs/ObjectRelationalMapping
   object-relational mapping] features
   - Full support and auto-exploration of
     [/docs/fActiveRecord#RelatedRecordsOperations foreign key relationships]
   - Simple, shorthand notation for [fRecordSet querying sets of records]
   - [/docs/fActiveRecord#CreatingandLoadingRecords Multi-column primary key
     support]
   - [/docs/fORM#ExtendingtheORM A simple plugin system] using hooks and
     callbacks
 - It can [/docs/fImage manipulate images] and automatically detects if GD or
   ImageMagick is installed
 - It provides [/docs/fNumber precise number support] even without the
   [http://php.net/bc bcmath] extension
 - It backports some PHP 5.2+ functionality to PHP 5.1 such as [/docs/fCookie
   Httponly cookies] and [fJSON JSON]
 - It includes [/docs/fCore error/exception handling and debugging features]
   that make bug fixing much simpler 
 - It is [/docs/InternationalizationLocalization built with
   internationalization and localization in mind]

== General Themes ==

 - Almost every single one of the 59 classes provides functionality
   useful to end-developers and the class APIs have been tweaked to be easy to
   use and understand
 - There is no desire for the project to provide an MVC architecture/framework,
   instead the focus is on providing a usable and modular set of classes to
   help solve common web development issues 
 - Instead of having monolithic and infrequent releases, each class is
   versioned separately and the library as a whole is versioned by the
   subversion revision number for easy updates and bug fixes
