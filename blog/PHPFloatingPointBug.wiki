= PHP Floating Point Bug =

Just last week a rather serious denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was
found in PHP, affecting versions 5.2.0 through 5.2.16 and 5.3.0 through 5.3.4.
The bug, [http://bugs.php.net/53632 #53632], causes PHP to enter an infinite
loop when working with the value `2.2250738585072011e-308` as a floating point
number. The simple submission of this value to a site multiple times can easily
cause the web server to become unresponsive to users.

The good news is that if you are using fRequest::get() and passing `float` to
the `$cast_to` parameter and Flourish r950 or newer, you will be automatically
protected from this vulnerability. The value `2.2250738585072011e-308` will be
converted to `2.2250738585072012e-308`, which resolves to the same floating
point value, but does not cause the infinite loop.

If you are using an older revision of Flourish, I strongly recommend you use
the `flourish.rev` file in your Flourish directory with the
[/docs/BackwardsCompatibilityBreak backwards compatibility breaks page] to
upgrade your code to the latest revision.
