= Testing Across 12 OSes, 10 Versions of PHP and 6 Databases =

Part of the goal of Flourish is to provide a solid library of code to build
web apps and websites on top of. Since PHP runs on such a variety of operating
systems and many users do not control the server they are installed on,
operating system and PHP version compatibility is important. Thanks to recent
donations by [http://imarc.net iMarc] and Luke Foreman, the [/docs/Tests
testing setup] has been expanded to include OS X 10.6 and Windows Server 2008.

With these changes, [/docs/Tests over 60,000 tests] are run with every SVN
commit, on a total of 10 different versions of PHP, running on 12 different
server environments. All database-related tests are run on the six supported
databases, and most are run using each of the 14 supported database extensions
against eight different database versions. In situations where Flourish
provides a pure-PHP fallback implementation of a non-standard PHP extension,
the tests are run both with the non-standard extension loaded and not.

At the end of the day, this helps to ensure that Flourish will work if you
deploy it on a RHEL 4 server running PHP 5.1.6, a Windows Server 2008 machine
running PHP 5.3.3 or a Solaris box with PHP 5.2.9.

== The Setup ==

Throwing around numbers is great and all, but I'd like to touch on the setup
a little bit. Flourish uses [http://phpunit.de PHPUnit] for unit and
integration tests. And yes, many of the test aren't true unit tests. Since
portability and compatibility are key, I want all of the code to actually run.
If I were to have written pure unit tests, I would have mocked all sorts of
dependencies and missed quite a number of bugs in PHP and bizarre edge cases.

PHPUnit contains an awesome amount of functionality, however when I started
with it, it did not allow for running tests with different PHP configuration.
I wouldn't be surprised if [http://twitter.com/s_bergmann Sebastian] has added
the functionality in 3.4 or 3.5, but I started this whole process back with
3.3 so I created my own solution. There is a PHP test runner `tests.php` that
parses class config files and runs the tests once for each different
configuration. It has evolved over time, and isn't the prettiest thing I've
ever written, but it gets the job done.

`tests.php` includes some other functionality, including a column-based,
color-coded shell output for interactive testing and JSON output for automated
testing. It allows for configuration values to be passed at run time (through a
nasty PHP ini hack) so that passwords don't need to be hard coded in the tests
and inadvertantly leaked through a source code repositories. In addition, you
can included or exclude specific classes and filter the configurations to be
run.

Once the local test runner once was written, I went to work setting up a bunch
of virtual machines. There are a total of 12 VMs running on two different
physical machines, an Intel i7 quad-core with 8GB of ram and a dual-core iMac
with 3GB ram. One of the virtual machines runs DB2, MySQL, Oracle and
PostgreSQL, while another runs SQL Server 2005 and 2008. Every machine,
including Windows, is running OpenSSH, allowing for key-based authentication
and distribution of the tests. I leave the stock OS configuration alone as much
as possible, but install PHP, various extensions, PHPUnit, some command line
database programs and configure the various local sendmail implementations to
route through an SMTP relay. Where possible I use the OS-supplied PHP packages
in an effort to find bugs related to common environments.

To run the rests on the virtual machines, I use a custom bash script
`remote_tests.sh` that `scp`s a tarball to each machine and then invokes
`tests.php` over `ssh`. `remote_tests.sh` allows for parallel execution of the
test scripts for the different database types, however I found that performance
decreased due to disk thrashing. It also allows checking the remote server
configuration to show the installed PHP version and the install status of both
required and optional PHP extensions.

I haven't spent much time abstracting or refining this setup for use by others,
but I could see it being useful for library and framework maintainers. You can
