= About =

Flourish is an independent PHP library that I have developed during the past
few years of my free time. Unsatisfied with the current options available for
PHP frameworks and libraries, I took it upon myself to build one that would
fulfill my needs. As the project progressed I made the decision to release it
as open source, in the hope that it would save someone else from having to
rewrite a similar solution.

If you are interested in the needs that Flourish helps fulfill, please check
out the [/docs/MotivationsForFlourish Motivations for Flourish] page.

My name is Will Bond, and I live in Newbury, MA, about 30 minutes north of
Boston. During the day I work as the Senior Tech Architect at

I spend most of my free time with my wife and children. 

If you are from around the North Shore in MA, please drop by one of the
