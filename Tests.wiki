= Tests =

Flourish has a set of unit and integration tests to help ensure bugs don’t
exist in the code base, helping developers focus on their code. These test
are performed on all code pushed to the
[https://github.com/flourishlib/flourish-staging flourish-staging repo].
Each chart represents a different operating system and PHP version
that the tests are run on. The tests source is available via
[https://github.com/flourishlib/flourish-tests GitHub].
