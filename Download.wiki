Started] and [/docs/HowDoI How Do I…?].

== Git ==

If you are just interested in using Flourish as part of another project, it
can be obtained from the `flourish-classes` repository on GitHub:

'''Git Repository:''' git://github.com/flourishlib/flourish-classes.git

'''Clone Command:''' `git clone git://github.com/flourishlib/flourish-classes.git`

'''GitHub Project:''' https://github.com/flourishlib/flourish-classes

=== Development ===

Primary Flourish development happens in git using GitHub as a central hub. The
main [https://github.com/flourishlib/flourish flourish] repository contains
submodules for the various parts of the Flourish infrastructure.

== SVN, Mercurial, Others ==

Flourish used to be developed in an SVN repository and synced to a number of
other version control systems. In early 2012 this system was migrated to
GitHub to allow for easier collaboration.

GitHub offers ways to checkout git repositories via 
[https://github.com/blog/966-improved-subversion-client-support SVN] and
[http://hg-git.github.com/ Mercurial]. Unfortunately the Darcs and Bazaar
systems are no longer supported.
