= PHP|Tek 2011 =

One week from today, the annual PHP|Tek conference returns to Chicago for the
2011 edition. I'm excited that I'm able to attend this year, and I'd love to
meet some Flourish users in person! So, whether you want to ask questions,
suggest improvements, or grill me on the finer points of how to over-use
regular expressions, I'm down. :-)

The easiest way to get in contact will be through Twitter
[http://twitter.com/flourishlib @flourishlib]. I'll also be
available via my personal account, [http://twitter.com/wbond @wbond], but I'm
going to try and keep that to replies. I look forward to meeting you there!
