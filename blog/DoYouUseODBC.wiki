= Do You Use ODBC? =

Recently I've been running into more issues with ODBC not properly handling
UTF-8 and blob data across the various databases that Flourish supports. I'm
very strongly considering dropping ODBC support due to the fact that:

 - None of the ODBC database drivers pass the tests on any OS but Windows
 - There is no way to tell DB2 to use the UTF-8 encoding with ODBC
 - Oracle via ODBC fails with UTF-8 so some characters must be escaped
   using `CHR()`
 - `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` isn't implemented for Oracle when using ODBC
 - The `pdo_odbc` driver in PHP 5.3 returns seemingly random data from an
   MSSQL blob column

Does anyone currently use an ODBC connection with fDatabase?

== Update ==

''7/31/10'' - As of revision 879, ODBC support is no longer
provided in any of Flourish's database classes. ODBC support was removed since
it was holding back perfect UTF-8 support, caused stability issues on some
servers and did not appear to be used by anyone.
