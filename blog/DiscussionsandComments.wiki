= Discussions and Comments =

Just a few days ago I posted links to Flourish on both
[http://news.ycombinator.com Hacker News] and the [http://reddit.com/r/PHP PHP
Reddit]. There has been some great conversation about Flourish on those sites
and on a thread over on the [http://codeigniter.com/forums/ CodeIgnitor forums].

 - [http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/102299/ CodeIgnitor Forums: Is the
   reign of frameworks over?]

If you run across any other conversations, I'd love to hear about them. And
as always, please feel free to comment on this post or
[http://forum.flourishlib.com start a thread] with any suggestions or questions
you may have.
